Solving Schrodinger’s equation for a particle in a finite 1-dimensional rectangular potential well
# Abstract
Schrodinger’s Equation is used to find the possible energy levels for a given quantum mechanical system.  In the case of a particle in a finite one-dimensional potential well, we are unable to solve the system analytically.  We can thus solve for the roots computationally by modeling the function at different potentials U_o and well lengths.
